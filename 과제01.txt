1. C언어와 자바 언어에서 변수의 life-time이 살아 있지만, 스코프에 존재하지 않는 경우의 예를 들어본다.
2.Consider the following pseudocode.
1 procedure main()
2     a : integer := 1
3     b : integer := 2

4     procedure middle()
5         b : integer := a
6         procedure inner()
7             print a, b

8         a : integer := 3
9         –– body of middle
10        inner()
11        print a, b
12    –– body of main
13    middle()
14    print a, b

Suppose this was code for a language with the declaration-order rules of C (but with nested subroutines)—that is, names must be declared before use, and the scope of a name extends from its declaration through the end of the block. At each print statement, indicate which declarations of a and b are in the referencing environment. What does the program print (or will the compiler identify static semantic errors)? Repeat the exercise for the declaration-order rules of C# (names must be declared before use, but the scope of a name is the entire block in which it is declared).

3. Consider the following pseudocode, assuming nested subroutines and static scope.
procedure main()
    g : integer
    
    procedure B(a : integer)
        x : integer

        procedure A(n : integer)
            g := n

        procedure R(m : integer)
            write integer(x)
            x /:= 2 –– integer division
            if x > 1
                R(m + 1)
            else
                A(m)
        
        –– body of B
        x := a × a
        R(1)
    
    –– body of main
    B(3)
    write integer(g)
    
(a) What does this program print?
(b) Show the frames on the stack when A has just been called. For each frame, show the static and dynamic links

4. Consider the following fragment of code in C:
{
    int a, b, c;
    ...
    {
        int d, e;
        ...
        {
            int f;
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
    {
        int g, h, i;
        ...
    }
    ...
}

Assume that each integer variable occupies four bytes. How much total space is required for the variables in this code?

5. Consider the following pseudocode:

procedure P(A, B : real)
    X : real
    procedure Q(B, C : real)
        Y : real
        . . .

    procedure R(A, C : real)
        Z : real
        . . .                      –– (*)
    . . .
    
Assuming static scope, what is the referencing environment at the location marked by (*)?
